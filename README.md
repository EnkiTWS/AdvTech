<p>Welcome to Emerald’s Adventure Tech! This is made for people who want both high tech and advanced storage and power systems and intense adventuring with dungeons, with a magic system and random Monster encounters. The tech side of this pack contains modes such as Mekanism, Applied Energistics 2, fusion reactors, and Industrial Forgoing. I paired this with a robust magic system of Mana and artifice, and Botania. Across the Biomes O'Plenty landscape, there are scattered buildings, ruins, and guaranteed random boss encounters that show up in the form of a lightning strike! When you're done adventuring you have plenty of options at your disposal such as Adorn, EmbellishCraft and Supplementaries to build your empire!</p>

<p>But there’s more, you also have the option of adding stat points to your character to bring more customizable options to the way you want to play!

Do you want to be a Glass cannon with little health but can destroy everything? Do you want to be a Tank that charges headfirst into slay a Boss in a dungeon!? You can do that!
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first load into the world you start with only 6 health, why? Because this is how a good adventure starts! You start with nothing, starving and you fight yourself to the top. As you eat more unique types of foods you will gain additional health points, up to a max of 60 health!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now not everyone LOVES the complicated ME storage system of Applied energistics. This is why Storage drawers are also a part of this pack! If you want to get adventuring without building an elaborate storage and power grid? Go no further I’ve got you covered! If you want a pack that’s going to be a bit rough out of the gate, but before long you will be a force to be reckoned with? This is the pack for you!

Whether you're a builder, a Grinder, a Tech Savvy Guru, or an adventurer, Emeralds Adventure Tech has something for everybody!</span></p>
